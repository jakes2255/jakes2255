# 👋Building Enterprise Apps with Clean Code & UX Excellence

🧑‍💻 Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience in designing and delivering enterprise applications across India and the UK. Passionate about scalable architectures, clean code, and user-centric solutions.

## 💼 What I Do (a.k.a My Superpowers):
- 🧠 **SAP Fiori & SAPUI5 Specialist** — because I believe great UI makes business processes less boring 😄  
- 🌐 Deep knowledge of **OData, Web Dynpro (ABAP/Java), and Enterprise Portals**  
- ☁️ Pro in **S/4HANA (on-premise & BTP)** with modern integration practices  
- 🔁 Devoted to **Agile**, addicted to **Scrum**, and fluent in **DevOps**

## 🚀 Roles I’ve Played:
- Solution Architect  
- Team Lead  
- Code whisperer  
- The person who fixes things no one else wants to touch 😉

## ❤️ What Drives Me:
I live for the moment when a client smiles because something *just works* — clean code, intuitive UX, happy people. That’s the magic I strive for.
