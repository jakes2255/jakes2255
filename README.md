<!-- ## Hey everyone, I'm 'Jakes2255', aka Arun Jacob 👋-->

# 👋 Hello World! I'm a Code-Crafter from Bangalore 🇮🇳

🧑‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer with nearly **two decades** of hands-on experience (yes, I started coding when flip phones were cool). Since **2005**, I’ve been building, leading, and shaping enterprise applications across India and the UK — solving real-world problems with scalable code and a client-first mindset.

## 💼 What I Do (a.k.a My Superpowers):
- 🧠 **SAP Fiori & SAPUI5 Specialist** — because I believe great UI makes business processes less boring 😄  
- 🌐 Deep knowledge of **OData, Web Dynpro (ABAP/Java), and Enterprise Portals**  
- ☁️ Pro in **S/4HANA (on-premise & BTP)** with modern integration practices  
- 🔁 Devoted to **Agile**, addicted to **Scrum**, and fluent in **DevOps**

## 🚀 Roles I’ve Played:
- Solution Architect  
- Team Lead  
- Code whisperer  
- The person who fixes things no one else wants to touch 😉

## ❤️ What Drives Me:
I live for the moment when a client smiles because something *just works* — clean code, intuitive UX, happy people. That’s the magic I strive for.

> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” — Martin Fowler  
> ...And I try to do that before my coffee kicks in ☕.
